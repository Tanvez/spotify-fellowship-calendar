This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Spotify Fellowship Application - Calendar App
This project is build using React, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, and React-Redux
Unit and Intergration test is done with Chai, Mocha, and Supertest

Note: I could not change the src folders name to CalendarFrontend because of create-react-app.
